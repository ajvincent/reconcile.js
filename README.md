# Reconcile.js  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/nyxtom/reconcile.js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nyxtom/reconcile.js)
Reconcile is a simple diff, patch and merge implementation that leverages
the reconciliation concept algorithm presented from Facebook's React.js library.
The goal of this library is to provide a very simple utility for performing diffs,
patches and merges of html documents. The strategy is done such that you should be able
to perform two-way or three-way merges depending on the context. Refer to
Facebook React -
[Reconciliation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html)
for a more in depth look at how this algorithm is meant to function.

### Features

- non-destructive diff between two HTML DOM Element Trees
- diff operations supported:
  - **removeAttribute**, **setAttribute**
  - **replaceText**
  - **moveChildElement**, **insertChildElement**, **removeChildElement**
- three-way merging between two diff changesets with automatic conflict resolution
- forward/reverse diff checks on move/insert/remove to generate reduced changeset

### TODO/Issues

- Handle style values or any custom attributes with care for key/value updates (avoid bulk replaces)
- Removing a parent element and a change to a subtree of a parent should generate a conflict
- Generate text-diff for textnodes to reduce conflicts and create more minimal changes
- Create Demo Diff Viewer

### Installation

To install from npm, simply use the following command. Otherwise you can
just clone the repo and use **reconcile.umd.js** or
**reconcile.umd.min.js**. This library uses the [UMD (Universal Module
Definition)](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) pattern for JavaScript modules.

```
npm install reconcile.js
```

### Diff Nodes
Based on Facebook's Reconciliation algorithm, the approach for a O(n) diff and merge  
algorithm is much preferred over traditional tree diff algorithms. Reconciliation will
treat each node as unique in the context of its type, attributes, tags and content. When
performing a diff and patch, the implementation will generate an array of actions that
were made when transforming a given target content to the source element. Additionally,
to avoid having to iterate over the elements a second time, we transform the target node
to speed up the process while we are generating the diff itself. To generate a diff of
the changes from source to target, use the following code:

```
var changes = reconcile.diff(source, target);
```

This should give you a list of changes which you can then apply to the target with:

```
reconcile.apply(changes, target);
```

**diff** will use a forward and backward run on the move/insertion/remove operations 
in order to generate the smallest possible changeset. This should help reduce the possible 
conflicts that may occur as you encounter three-way merges for multiple patches below.

### Patch Nodes
If you wish to apply additional changes on top of an existing changeset. You can do
this easily by creating a patch from your diff arguments. You should be careful to
apply each changeset in the order you received your diffs. Each patch will perform
a three-way merge changeset which can then be applied afterwords.

```
var theirs = reconcile.diff(theirSource, base);
var mine = reconcile.diff(mySource, base);
var changes = reconcile.patch(theirs, mine);
var result = reconcile.apply(changes, base);
// result.conflicts is an array of conflicts that may have been encountered
// if you see this, your base node will have <theirs>, and <mine> next to
// each other within the changeset, and conflicts will return an array
// of conflicted nodes which you can choose what you will with them
```
